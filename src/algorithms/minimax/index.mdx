### Usage
The Minimax algorithm determines the best possible score in a game after players get to move a certain number of times. Minimax is only applicable in 2-player games, where the gain of player *A* is exactly the loss of player *B*.

### Implementation

`embed:minimax.cpp`

### Description

The algorithm is split into two functions, `max` and `min`, which are called recursivly from each other. Both functions take turns at each depth like players take turns in a game. By playing all possible moves for each position, a game tree is generated. If depth is 0, the position is then evaluated according to side and the score is propagated back. Now, each depth in the tree represents the possible outcomes for player *A* or player *B*.

For all nodes in the tree, the player to turn chooses the move that scores best for him: The maximizing player decides to take the highest score while the minimizing player takes the lowest score. Therefore, the best outcome at each node is propagated back to the parent node. The root node receives the bets score, if both players always play their best moves.

### Complexity
**Time**
For a branching factor *b* and depth *d*:
$$\mathcal{O}(b^d)$$

**Space**
For maximum number of child nodes *n* for all nodes and depth *d*:
$$\mathcal{O}(b \cdot d)$$
