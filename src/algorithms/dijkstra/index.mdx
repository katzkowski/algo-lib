<!-- Intro -->

Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes _A_ and _B_ in a given graph _G_, if the weight of all edges is positive. A shortest path minimizes the sum of weights between to nodes in a graph. The algorithm utilizes a greedy approach as the sub-path with minimal total weight is expanded first in each iteration.

## Implementation

```js
function dijkstra(G, A):
    // Declare queue
    Queue q

    // Store node cost for all nodes in G
    nodeCosts = new Array[nodes]
    ant = new Array[nodes]

    // Init all node costs
    for nodes in G:
        nodeCosts[node] = INFINITY
        ant[node] = NULL
        q.add(node)

    // Node cost to start is zero
    nodeCost[A] = 0

    while !q.isEmpty():
        // Find node that is expanded with minimal cost
        v = minimalExplorablePath(nodeCosts)
        q.remove(v)

        // Update distance neighbors of v
        for neighbors n of v:
            newDistance = nodeCost[n] + distance(n, v)
            if newDistance < nodeCost[n]:
                nodeCost[n] = newDistance
                ant[n] = v
end
```

## Explanation

### Algorithm

The algorithm assigns a _node cost_ to each node, which represents the lowest known distance from the start _A_ to the node so far. At start, these distances are unknown and therefore set to infinity. The variable _q_ denotes a queue holding all unvisited nodes, which are initially all nodes in _G_. As soon as a node is visited, it is removed from _q_.

In each iteration the algorithm has to choose, which edge is explored next. The basic idea is to calculate a tentative distance to all unvisited nodes and chose the edge providing the minimal tentative distance. The minimum combination of _node cost + cost of unexplored incident edge_ is easily obtained from the `nodeCosts` array and indidactes the best candidate to be explored. Note that unvisited nodes have a _node cost_ of infinity and thus only edges incident to nodes in _q_ have a chance to be picked. The newly visited node _C_ is then removed from _q_ to ensure that this node is never explored twice. Edges incident to _C_ might provide a shorter path to nodes that are already visited. If a path via _C_ can improve _node cost_ of an already explored node, the corresponding node costs are updated. As the algorithm does not explores towards the goal _B_ but along the shortest path, this invariant assures the optimal distance between _A_ and _B_ when all nodes are explored and _q_ is empty.

### Implementation

The basic algorithm only calculates the shortest distance between _A_ and _B_. In order compute the actual shortest path as a series of edges, nodes store an antecessor in addition to their _node cost_. If edges incident to a newly explored node _C_ provide a shorter path via _C_ to an already visited node _D_, then _node costs_ of _D_ are updated and the antecessor of _D_ is set to _C_, because the shortest path to _D_ is now via _C_. If every node stores its antecessor, the shortest path can be computed by going along all antecessors starting from end node _B_. This technique even allows to calculate the shortest path to _B_ from _all_ nodes in the given graph.

The queue _q_ is used to obtain the minimal tentative costs possible. Modern approaches implement a priority queue to achieve a better running time.

## Usage

```js
Graph G = new Graph(V, E)
start = A
target = B
shortestPath = [] // Shortest path is inserted here

// Fill in nodeCost and antecessor arrays
dijkstra(G, start)

// Backtracking to
if ant[target] != NULL:
    while ant[target] != NULL:
        temp = ant[target]
        shortestPath.insert(temp)
```
