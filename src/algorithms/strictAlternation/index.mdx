<!-- Intro -->

Strict-Alternation is an algorithm to solve the mutual exclusion problem. This problem occurs, when a resource shared between multiple processes has to be protected from simultaneous read and write operations. These so called critical sections need algorithms like Strict-Alternation to grant mutually exclusive access on the shared resource. Otherwise, processes might read corrupted data because another process has not finished a write operation yet.

Strict-Alternation is always fair. However, there are situations where Strict-Alternation might end up in a deadlock. Therefore, this algorithm is only used for academic purposes while other approaches like Fisher's algorithm find attention in real world applications.

## Implementation

```cpp
// Global variable indicates current procces in critical section
turn = 0

// Fixed number of processes, for example 10
numProc = 10

// Get mutually exclusive access for i-th process
function enterCritical(ID):
    while x != ID:
        continue
endfunction

// Reset global variable for waiting processes
function leaveCritical():
    ID = (ID + 1) % numProc
endfunction
```

## Explanation

Consider _numProc_ - many processes with distinct process IDs that are trying to access a shared resource _m_. The algorithm uses a global turn variable `turn` to determine which process is allowed to enter the critical section. This variable is initially set to `0` and from there on only updated by the process currently in the critical section. Consequently, `turn` is always safe to read at all times and cannot be corrupted. After the _i_-th process finished mofifying _m_, the `turn` variable is set to the next process _(i + 1) % numProc_. Other processes trying to enter the critical section have to wait until their `ID` is set.

Strict-Alternation assumes that the next process in line wants to access _m_. If for any reason the process does not enter the critical section, the `turn` variable never gets updated - a deadlock occurs. This flaw makes the algorithm hardly usuable in real world applications.

## Usage

The following pseudocode provides an example how a process with `ID = 1` enters the critical section to modify a shared resource _m_.

```cpp
function modifySharedMemory():
    // When enterCritical() returns, critical section is entered
    enterCritical(1)

    modify(m)

    leaveCritical()
endfunction
```
