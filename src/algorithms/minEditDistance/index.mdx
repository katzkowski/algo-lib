The Wagner-Fischer algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm which computes the (minimum) edit distance between two strings. It is often used in natural language processing (NLP) e.g. to correct spelling mistakes.

## Implementation

```cpp
// D: matrix, source: string, target: string
function minEditDistance(D, source, target):
    // get string lengths
    n = length(source)
    m = length(target)

    // distance between empty strings is 0
    D[0,0] = 0

    // insert distance from empty string
    // to source string into first column
    for (i = 1, i <= n, i++):
        D[i,0] = D[i-1, 0] + delCost(source[i])

    // insert distance from empty string
    // to target string into first row
    for (j = 1, j <= m, j++):
        D[0,j] = D[0, j-1] + insCost(target[j])

    // reccurence relation
    for (i = 1, i <= n, i++): // for each row i
        for (j = 1, j <= m, j++): // for each column j
            // minimum edit distance
            D[i,j] = min(D[i-1, j] + delCost(source[i]),
                         D[i, j-1] + insCost(target[j]),
                         D[i-1, j-1] + subCost(source[i], target[j]))


    return D[n,m]
```

## Explanation

To avoid repeated computations and increase speed, the Wagner-Fischer algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to compute edit distance.

The value at each position $[i,j]$ of the matrix describes the Levenshtein distance between both substrings, which is defined as the minimal cost of the operations necessary to change the first substring $source[1-i]$ into the second substring $target[1-j]$.

There are three types operations: **deletion** (cost 1), **insertion** (cost 1) and **substitution** (cost 2). As a substitution consists of a deletion followed by an insertion, its cost is doubled compared to single operation.

The algorithm fills the matrix bottom-up in an iterative manner. For each position $[i,j]$, the minimum edit distance is computed by taking the minimum value of the three possible paths through the matrix, which are:

- Deletion from the _top_ substring: $D[i-1, j] + delCost(source[i])$
- Insertion from the _left_ substring: $D[i, j-1] + insCost(target[j])$
- Substitution from the _diagonally top-left_ substring: $D[i-1, j-1] + subCost(source[i], target[j])$

In other words, each value $[i,j]$ is computed by taking the path with minimum edit cost from the already computed neighbors. This is where the dynamic programming approach becomes clear: the solution is determined based on previously computed sub-solutions.

## Applications

Whenever the edit distance is applied, the Wagner-Fischer algorithm can be used. In natural language processing, it can be used for the correction of spelling mistakes by finding the closest related word to the misspelled one.

Another use-case of the edit distance is in computational biology, where minimum edit distance can be used to align and compare different RNA nucleon sequences.
