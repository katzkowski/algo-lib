# algo-lib

<b>algo-lib</b> is an open library of algorithms with pseudo-code and explanations, which is maintained as a personal project by two computer science students. The project emerged from the idea to collect all algorithms, which we encounter during the studies, in one place. We then decided to publish our continuously updated library, so that others can benefit from our collection.
